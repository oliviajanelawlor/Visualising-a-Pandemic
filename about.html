          <h2>All about <I>Visualising a Pandemic in the UK</I></h2>
          <p class="lead">Since March, life has changed drastically no matter what situation people were living in. Everyone’s life changed. Maybe forever? Who knows. That may be a bit dramatic.<br></p> 

<br><p>The point is, we don’t even need to mention the word, nor the phrase. This situation has entirely consumed our news, conversations, thoughts, fears and pretty much our lives. <br>

<br>We now have a better chance of guessing what those two friends on their social distancing picnic are talking about. We can presume that our neighbour has had to return early from their food shopping because they forgot their mask. <br>

<br>We now understand the true meaning behind the phrase “these are unprecedented times”. <br>

<br>COVID-19 has been a challenge for every industry and person across the globe. The anxiety has most likely been felt by everybody you know and those you don’t. We have had to adapt to new living conditions and have had no option but to accept them. <br>

<br>On this site, you will find a variety of stories inspired by data releases published by the UK Government. After all, data is what has been critical in monitoring the spread of Coronavirus. <br>

<br>Ensuring to interpret the data correctly, time and care has been spent on looking into methodologies of the figures, to guarantee all statistics are understood, visualised and told how the Government have presented them.<br>

<br>So, welcome to <i>Visualising a Pandemic in the UK.</i><br>
